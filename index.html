    <h3 class="text-center mb-4">A crescent shaped wonder</h3>
    <p class="text-center">The dough is typically layered with butter, then rolled, and folded several times in a process called lamination. The
    final dough is cut into triangles and rolled into a crescent shape.The process of lamination results in a layered, flaky
    textured roll, more like puff pastry.
    <br />
    The main ingredients in a croissant are flour, yeast, salt, sugar, milk, water, eggs and butter.
    <br />
    A well baked croissant should be flaky and crisp on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. It should be evenly
    baked and well aerated.</p>
